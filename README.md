# Xinjie Ye's Resume

Thanks for stopping by! This repository exists so you can quickly grab the most up-to-date version of my resume.

## Quick Start
1. Click `xinjie-resume.pdf` in this repository (or download it) to open the latest resume.
2. Use your PDF viewer to zoom for readability or print to paper if needed.
3. When sharing with someone else, send the PDF itself. It is kept current, so you can rely on it being the latest version.

## What You Will Find
- `xinjie-resume.pdf` - the only file you need. It contains my complete resume laid out exactly how I send it to employers.

## Version Notes
- The file in this repository is always the canonical public version. If I ever provide a custom-tailored resume directly to you, please reference that version for your specific opportunity.
- Previous iterations may exist in the git history; feel free to explore commits if you need to see how my experience evolved over time.

## Questions?
Open an issue or send me a message (if you already have my contact information). I'm happy to provide additional materials or answer any follow-up questions.
